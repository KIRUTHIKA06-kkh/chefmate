Build an intelligent application that clusters and recommends restaurants based on user input, such as cuisine or dishes, and integrates a chef-like chatbot assistant for guiding users in preparing recipes.

Technical Tags : Streamlit, AWS S3, AWS RDS, AWS EC2, Machine Learning, Clustering, Chatbot, Data Visualization, Python.

Skills : Streamlit application development,Machine learning model training (clustering),AWS services (S3, RDS, EC2),Data cleaning and preprocessing,
Integration of ML models with applications,Building dynamic user interfaces,Chatbot integration for user interaction.

Procedure : 
   1.Push raw restaurant and recipe data (JSON format) to an AWS S3 bucket.
   2.Pull data from S3, clean, and preprocess it for model training
   3.Store the cleaned data in AWS RDS for structured querying.
   4.Train a clustering model using the data pulled from RDS to group restaurants by similarities.
   5.Implement restaurant recommendations with maps, ratings, and visualizations.
   6.Develop a chatbot for guiding recipe preparation with conversational AI.
   7.Host the model and application on an AWS EC2 instance for real-time interaction.
